# Bank Loan Performance Dashboard
# Problem Statement
## Performance tracking of loan portfolios by banks becomes truly difficult without a central and transparent view of the major key metrics. It then becomes problematic to measure loan application trends, disbursement efficiency, and also borrower repayment behaviour over time. This project will address this by creating an interactive dashboard to track major KPIs, including total number of loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, average interest rates, and borrower debt-to-income ratio.In terms of offering bank management and analysts with month-to-date and month-over-month insights, this project provides them with a means to assess how healthy a loan portfolio is, to identify trends, and to make decisions that are informed by fact to improve their overall loan performance. It also enables the differentiation between performing and at-risk loans, thereby supporting action at the point of need for overall better financial outcomes.
# Purpose
## This project helps monitor and analyse key metrics for bank loan performance over specific periods. Key purposes include:


Tracking Loan Applications: Keeps a record of the total number of loan applications received during a specific period, including month-to-date (MTD) applications, and tracks month-over-month (MoM) changes.

Funded Amount Analysis: Provides insights into the total amount of funds disbursed, monitors the MTD total funded amount, and tracks MoM changes in disbursed funds.

Cash Flow and Loan Repayment: Tracks the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bankâ€™s cash flow and monitor loan repayment performance.

Average Interest Rate: Calculates the average interest rate across all loans and monitors MTD and MoM variations, offering insights into the overall cost of the lending portfolio.

Debt-to-Income (DTI) Analysis: Evaluates the average DTI for borrowers, gauging financial health by computing the average DTI across all loans, MTD, and tracking MoM fluctuations.

Loan Quality Differentiation: Distinguishes between good and bad loans, using specific KPIs to evaluate loan quality.

Data Visualization: Presents various charts and visuals for clear and understandable data representation.
